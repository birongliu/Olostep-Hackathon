# Web Scraper and AI Analysis Tool

This project is a comprehensive web scraping and analysis tool that automates the extraction, processing, and presentation of data from various web sources. It leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver insights through a streamlined and user-friendly web interface.

### Key Features:
- **Web Scraping:** The tool uses Puppeteer to scrape data from specified URLs efficiently, handling complex websites with dynamic content.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** The scraped data is analyzed using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model, which is accessed through OpenRouter. This enables sophisticated natural language understanding and content categorization.
- **Automation:** With GitHub Actions, the tool supports automated scraping and analysis tasks, reducing manual intervention and ensuring up-to-date data.
- **User Interface:** The frontend, built with Next.js, provides an intuitive and responsive user interface. Users can easily input URLs, trigger scraping, and view the AI-generated analysis results.
- **Backend:** The server-side logic is powered by Node.js and Express, ensuring efficient data processing and handling multiple concurrent requests.
- **Database Management:** MongoDB is used for scalable data storage and retrieval, offering fast and reliable access to scraped and analyzed data.
- **Extensibility:** The modular design allows for easy integration of additional AI models, data processing workflows, or frontend features, making the tool adaptable to evolving requirements.

### Advanced Capabilities:
- **Data Export:** Users can export analyzed data in various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.), facilitating further offline analysis or integration with other systems.
- **Customizable Scraping Rules:** The scraping mechanism is customizable, allowing users to define specific scraping rules for different websites, including handling pagination, forms, and login sequences.
- **Real-time Data Processing:** The system supports real-time data scraping and analysis, enabling users to obtain insights as soon as the data is available.
- **Scalability:** Built with scalability in mind, the tool can handle a large number of concurrent scraping tasks and analyses without compromising performance.
- **Security:** Data privacy and security are prioritized with secure data transmission, authentication mechanisms, and adherence to best practices in web scraping ethics.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer
- **AI Analysis:** OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo via OpenRouter
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions

### Future Enhancements:
- **Multi-language Support:** Adding multi-language support to broaden the tool's applicability to non-English websites and users.
- **Dashboard Analytics:** Developing a dashboard that visualizes key metrics from scraped data, providing users with graphical insights at a glance.
- **AI Model Upgrades:** Regular updates to the AI model to leverage the latest advancements in natural language processing, improving the quality and depth of analysis.
